 my five years old daughter mini cannot live without chatter i really believe that in all her life she have not waste a minute in silence her mother be often vex at this and would stop her prattle but i would not to see mini quiet be unnatural and i cannot bear it long and so my own talk with her be always lively one morning for instance when i be in the midst of the seventeenth chapter of my new novel my little mini steal into the room and put her hand into mine say father ramdayal the doorkeeper call a crow a krow he doesnt know anything do he before i could explain to her the differences of language in this world she be embark on the full tide of another subject what do you think father bhola say there be an elephant in the cloud blow water out of his trunk and that be why it rain and then dart off anew while i sit still make ready some reply to this last say father what relation be mother to you with a grave face i contrive to say go and play with bhola mini i be busy the window of my room overlook the road the child have seat herself at my feet near my table and be play softly drum on her knees i be hard at work on my seventeenth chapter where pratap singh the hero have just catch kanchanlata the heroine in his arm and be about to escape with her by the thirdstory window of the castle when all of a sudden mini leave her play and run to the window cry a cabuliwallah a cabuliwallah sure enough in the street below be a cabuliwallah pass slowly along he wear the loose soil clothe of his people with a tall turban there be a bag on his back and he carry box of grapes in his hand i cannot tell what be my daughters feel at the sight of this man but she begin to call him loudly ah i think he will come in and my seventeenth chapter will never be finish at which exact moment the cabuliwallah turn and look up at the child when she saw this overcome by terror she flee to her mother protection and disappear she have a blind belief that inside the bag which the big man carry there be perhaps two or three other children like herself the pedlar meanwhile enter my doorway and greet me with a smile face so precarious be the position of my hero and my heroine that my first impulse be to stop and buy something since the man have be call i make some small purchase and a conversation begin about abdurrahman the russians the english and the frontier policy as he be about to leave he ask and where be the little girl sir and i think that mini must get rid of her false fear have her bring out she stand by my chair and look at the cabuliwallah and his bag he offer her nut and raisins but she would not be tempt and only cling the closer to me with all her doubt increase this be their first meet one morning however not many days later as i be leave the house i be startle to find mini seat on a bench near the door laugh and talk with the great cabuliwallah at her feet in all her life it appear my small daughter have never find so patient a listener save her father and already the corner of her little sari be stuff with almonds and raisins the gift of her visitor why do you give her those i say and take out an eightanna bite i hand it to him the man accept the money without demur and slip it into his pocket alas on my return an hour later i find the unfortunate coin have make twice its own worth of trouble for the cabuliwallah have give it to mini and her mother catch sight of the bright round object have pounce on the child with where do you get that eightanna bite the cabuliwallah give it me say mini cheerfully the cabuliwallah give it you cry her mother much shock o mini how could you take it from him i enter at the moment save her from impend disaster and proceed to make my own inquiries it be not the first or second time i find that the two have meet the cabuliwallah have overcome the childs first terror by a judicious bribery of nut and almonds and the two be now great friends they have many quaint joke which afford them much amusement seat in front of him look down on his gigantic frame in all her tiny dignity mini would ripple her face with laughter and begin o cabuliwallah cabuliwallah what have you get in your bag and he would reply in the nasal accent of the mountaineer an elephant not much cause for merriment perhaps but how they both enjoy the fun and for me this childs talk with a grownup man have always in it something strangely fascinate then the cabuliwallah not to be behindhand would take his turn well little one and when be you go to the fatherinlaws house now most small bengali maidens have hear long ago about the fatherinlaws house but we be a little newfangled have keep these things from our child and mini at this question must have be a trifle bewilder but she would not show it and with ready tact reply be you go there amongst men of the cabuliwallahs class however it be well know that the word fatherinlaws house have a double mean it be a euphemism for jail the place where we be well care for at no expense to ourselves in this sense would the sturdy pedlar take my daughters question ah he would say shake his fist at an invisible policeman i will thrash my fatherinlaw hear this and picture the poor discomfit relative mini would go off into peal of laughter in which her formidable friend would join these be autumn mornings the very time of year when kings of old go forth to conquest and i never stir from my little corner in calcutta would let my mind wander over the whole world at the very name of another country my heart would go out to it and at the sight of a foreigner in the streets i would fall to weave a network of dreams—the mountains the glens and the forest of his distant home with his cottage in its set and the free and independent life of faraway wilds perhaps the scenes of travel conjure themselves up before me and pass and repass in my imagination all the more vividly because i lead such a vegetable existence that a call to travel would fall upon me like a thunderbolt in the presence of this cabuliwallah i be immediately transport to the foot of arid mountain peak with narrow little defile twist in and out amongst their tower heights i could see the string of camels bear the merchandise and the company of turbanned merchants carry some their queer old firearms and some their spear journey downward towards the plain i could see— but at some such point minis mother would intervene implore me to beware of that man minis mother be unfortunately a very timid lady whenever she hear a noise in the street or see people come towards the house she always jump to the conclusion that they be either thieve or drunkards or snake or tigers or malaria or cockroaches or caterpillars even after all these years of experience she be not able to overcome her terror so she be full of doubt about the cabuliwallah and use to beg me to keep a watchful eye on him i try to laugh her fear gently away but then she would turn round on me seriously and ask me solemn questions— be children never kidnap be it then not true that there be slavery in cabul be it so very absurd that this big man should be able to carry off a tiny child i urge that though not impossible it be highly improbable but this be not enough and her dread persist as it be indefinite however it do not seem right to forbid the man the house and the intimacy go on unchecked once a year in the middle of january rahmun the cabuliwallah be in the habit of return to his country and as the time approach he would be very busy go from house to house collect his debts this year however he could always find time to come and see mini it would have seem to an outsider that there be some conspiracy between the two for when he could not come in the morning he would appear in the even even to me it be a little startle now and then in the corner of a dark room suddenly to surprise this tall loosegarmented much bebagged man but when mini would run in smile with her o cabuliwallah cabuliwallah and the two friends so far apart in age would subside into their old laughter and their old joke i felt reassure one morning a few days before he have make up his mind to go i be correct my proof sheet in my study it be chilly weather through the window the ray of the sun touch my feet and the slight warmth be very welcome it be almost eight oclock and the early pedestrians be return home with their head cover all at once i hear an uproar in the street and look out saw rahmun be lead away bind between two policemen and behind them a crowd of curious boys there be bloodstains on the clothe of the cabuliwallah and one of the policemen carry a knife hurry out i stop them and inquire what it all mean partly from one partly from another i gather that a certain neighbour have owe the pedlar something for a rampuri shawl but have falsely deny have buy it and that in the course of the quarrel rahmun have strike him now in the heat of his excitement the prisoner begin call his enemy all sort of name when suddenly in a verandah of my house appear my little mini with her usual exclamation o cabuliwallah cabuliwallah rahmuns face light up as he turn to her he have no bag under his arm today so she could not discuss the elephant with him she at once therefore proceed to the next question be you go to the fatherinlaws house rahmun laugh and say just where i be go little one then see that the reply do not amuse the child he hold up his fetter hand ah he say i would have thrash that old fatherinlaw but my hand be bind on a charge of murderous assault rahmun be sentence to some years imprisonment time pass away and he be not remember the accustom work in the accustom place be ours and the think of the once free mountaineer spend his years in prison seldom or never occur to us even my lighthearted mini i be ashamed to say forget her old friend new companion fill her life as she grow older she spend more of her time with girls so much time indeed do she spend with them that she come no more as she use to do to her father room i be scarcely on speak term with her years have pass away it be once more autumn and we have make arrangements for our minis marriage it be to take place during the puja holiday with durga return to kailas the light of our home also be to depart to her husband house and leave her father in the shadow the morning be bright after the rain there be a sense of ablution in the air and the sunrays look like pure gold so bright be they that they give a beautiful radiance even to the sordid brick wall of our calcutta lanes since early dawn that day the weddingpipes have be sound and at each beat my own heart throb the wail of the tune bhairavi seem to intensify my pain at the approach separation my mini be to be marry that night from early morning noise and bustle have pervade the house in the courtyard the canopy have to be sling on its bamboo pole the chandeliers with their tinkle sound must be hang in each room and verandah there be no end of hurry and excitement i be sit in my study look through the account when some one enter salute respectfully and stand before me it be rahmun the cabuliwallah at first i do not recognise him he have no bag nor the long hair nor the same vigour that he use to have but he smile and i know him again when do you come rahmun i ask him last even he say i be release from jail the word strike harsh upon my ears i have never before talk with one who have wound his fellow and my heart shrink within itself when i realise this for i felt that the day would have be betteromened have he not turn up there be ceremonies go on i say and i be busy could you perhaps come another day at once he turn to go but as he reach the door he hesitate and say may i not see the little one sir for a moment it be his belief that mini be still the same he have picture her run to him as she use call o cabuliwallah cabuliwallah he have imagine too that they would laugh and talk together just as of old in fact in memory of former days he have bring carefully wrap up in paper a few almonds and raisins and grapes obtain somehow from a countryman for his own little fund be disperse i say again there be a ceremony in the house and you will not be able to see any one today the man face fell he look wistfully at me for a moment then say good morning and go out i felt a little sorry and would have call him back but i find he be return of his own accord he come close up to me hold out his offer with the word i bring these few things sir for the little one will you give them to her i take them and be go to pay him but he catch my hand and say you be very kind sir keep me in your recollection do not offer me money—you have a little girl i too have one like her in my own home i think of her and bring fruit to your child—not to make a profit for myself say this he put his hand inside his big loose robe and bring out a small and dirty piece of paper with great care he unfold this and smooth it out with both hand on my table it bore the photograph not a draw the impression of an inksmeared hand lay flat on the paper this touch of his own little daughter have be always on his heart as he have come year after year to calcutta to sell his war in the streets tear come to my eye i forget that he be a poor cabuli fruitseller while i was— but no what be i more than he he also be a father that impression of the hand of his little pārbati in her distant mountain home remind me of my own little mini i send for mini immediately from the inner apartment many difficulties be raise but i would not listen clothe in the red silk of her weddingday with the sandal paste on her forehead and adorn as a young bride mini come and stand bashfully before me the cabuliwallah look a little stagger at the apparition he could not revive their old friendship at last he smile and say little one be you go to your fatherinlaws house but mini now understand the mean of the word fatherinlaw and she could not reply to him as of old she flush up at the question and stand before him with her bridelike face turn down i remember the day when the cabuliwallah and my mini have first meet and i felt sad when she have go rahmun heave a deep sigh and sit down on the floor the idea have suddenly come to him that his daughter too must have grow in this long time and that he would have to make friends with her anew assuredly he would not find her as he use to know her and besides what might not have happen to her in these eight years the marriagepipes sound and the mild autumn sun stream round us but rahmun sit in the little calcutta lane and saw before him the barren mountains of afghanistan i take out a banknote and give it to him say go back to your own daughter rahmun in your own country and may the happiness of your meet bring good fortune to my child have make this present i have to curtail some of the festivities i could not have the electric light i have intend nor the military band and the ladies of the house be despondent at it but to me the weddingfeast be all the brighter for the think that in a distant land a longlost father meet again with his only child
